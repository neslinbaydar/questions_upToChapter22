I answered some questions about JavaScript from ``JavaScript Notes for Professionals book``. You can check the ```explanations in HTML part```.

Also if you are a beginner in JS,you can check out this [book](https://www.computer-pdf.com/web-programming/javascript/833-tutorial-javascript-notes-for-professionals-book.html)ðŸ”Ž

It really helps you to understand some hard parts of JS.
